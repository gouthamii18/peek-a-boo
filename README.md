## Project Description
Peek-a-boo is an AI-powered assistant that listens to your voice and counts your blinks to launch applications ‚Äî because pressing buttons is *so* last century.  

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if‚Ä¶ opening Notepad required you to blink three times?  
And what if‚Ä¶ you could control your PC like a secret agent using only your eyelids?  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We combined **computer vision** and **voice recognition** to make Rambo ‚Äî a system that:  
- Listens for you to say ‚ÄúRambo blink‚Äù  
- Opens your webcam and counts your blinks  
- Launches apps like Notepad, Calculator, and Spotify without you lifting a finger
