## 📜 Project Description
**Peek-a-Boo** is an AI-powered assistant that listens to your voice and counts your blinks to launch applications — because pressing buttons is *so* last century.  

---

## ❓ The Problem (that doesn't exist)
- What if… opening Notepad required you to blink three times?  
- And what if… you could control your PC like a secret agent using only your eyelids?  

---

## 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We combined **computer vision** and **voice recognition** to create **Rambo**, a system that:  
- Listens for you to say **"Rambo blink"**  
- Opens your webcam and counts your blinks  
- Launches apps like **Notepad**, **Calculator**, and **Spotify** without you lifting a finger
